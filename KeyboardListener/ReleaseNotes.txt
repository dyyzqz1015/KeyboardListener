Version 1.0.1
-----------------
Fixed a bug that caused multi key combos not to work in other applications (i.e. Ctrl-C would no longer perform a copy).
Stopped the listener on destruction, even if StopListen was not explicitly called.




Version 1.0.0
-----------------
Initial Version.
Contains support for all keys and single key presses.
